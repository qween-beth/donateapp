This updated app.py file includes the following changes:

Added necessary imports for Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Bcrypt.
Configured the SQLAlchemy database URI to use a SQLite database file named donation.db.
Created two database models: User for user authentication and Donation for storing donation data.
Implemented user registration and login functionality using the User model and password hashing with Flask-Bcrypt.
Modified the /donate route to store donations in the Donation table.
Updated the /admin route to fetch all donations from the Donation table for the admin view.
Added an /approve/<id> route to approve donations based on the provided donation ID.
Created new routes for user registration (/signup) and login (/login) along with their corresponding submission routes.
Modified the /logout route to clear the user and admin session variables.
Created the necessary HTML templates: index.html, admin.html, thankyou.html, signup.html, and login.html.
Make sure to create the HTML templates in the same directory as the app.py file.

Once you've made these adjustments, you can run the Flask app using flask run or python app.py, and access it in your web browser at http://localhost:5000/.
